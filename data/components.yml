  description: ROBOTSBUILDINGROBOTS, LLC was founded in Boulder Colorado in 2016. Through successful engagements across Chicago, Manhattan, and Portland, Oregon we focus on delivering quality measured ROI through the products we engineer in-house, and the services we provide to our clients. Being brutally honest, and highly selective are part of our core values.  We are picky about the clients and projects we attach our name to, and you could say we are more focused on bringing impact, than merely collecting fees.  Ultimately we derive success through win-win partnerships.
