ethos: If you are only hiring in your local community and you are complaining you have no one to hire, you are creating your own problem based on outdated legacy minded human resource practices. Working remotely is not a privilege, it the way to get work done effectively, efficiently, and far more respectful of your employees' time. This post is not meant to sell your business on remote work, although we can provide services to help you configure it at the start, we want to highlight employee and business best practices. Consider this our remote ethos.
