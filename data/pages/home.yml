process: Whether augmented bolt-on resources or individual projects we utilize Kanban or Scrum for our agile workflows. This includes grooming, sizing, retros and stand-ups. Waterfall equates to chaos and it’s not something we’re interested in. All of our engagements are tracked hourly, invoiced weekly, and require payment less than or equal to NET-15. Engagement success occurs when product and engineering work together with a shared vision and goals to completion. In every case, we mandate transparency throughout the entire process and continually evaluate each component of our workflows to maintain a high level of efficiency and value. If you do not like a minimum level of the engagement process, we are not interested in working with you.

metrics: We never take clients that don’t pay for automated tests. At a foundational level, we believe they are critical to the success of writing software. If you’re wanting to cut this corner, don’t worry, you can find many cheaper options out there. We’ll pass, but call us when you’re application melts down and no one knows why. Tests are not the only feature that matters. We advocate for community-driven coding style approaches utilizing tools like rubocop, eslint, and stylelint. It’s better to code with the community than increase our DSL just to be “cool.” Finally, we grade our work with tools like Code Climate, Simplecov, and RubyCritic. Knowing these metrics increases confidence in what we are producing, reduces unnecessary complexity, and prevents defects.

values: 3Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
