values: First and foremost, we are craftsmen. We intrinsically value the work we accomplish, the meticulous attention to detail, and the quality of our work. We understand that we are not perfect; software processes are not perfect; bugs are inevitable. With over 15 years of experience in technology from startups to enterprises, we understand every business presents a unique set of challenges, and we tailor our approach accordingly.

process: Whether augmented bolt-on resources or individual projects, we utilize Kanban or Scrum for our agile workflows. We are not interested in waterfall or pure chaos. All engagements are tracked hourly, invoiced weekly, and require NET-7. A successful engagement with us occurs when product and engineering work together with a shared vision and goals to completion.

technology: We leverage cutting-edge tools and modern frameworks to build scalable, maintainable solutions. From AI and machine learning integration to cloud-native architecture, we stay ahead of the curve. Our automated testing and CI/CD pipelines ensure rapid, reliable deployments. We embrace innovation while maintaining production stability.

roi: We believe in building win-win partnerships with measurable outcomes. Every project we take on must deliver clear value and help our clients succeed. We focus on cost-effective solutions that drive real business results, not gold-plated features nobody asked for. Our goal is your long-term success, not just a signed contract.

metrics: At a foundational level, we believe automated tests are critical to the success of writing software. We advocate for community-driven, coding style approaches utilizing code linters and we grade our code with testing coverage metrics and style evaluation tools. If you are wanting to cut this corner, don't worry, you can find many cheaper options out there.
