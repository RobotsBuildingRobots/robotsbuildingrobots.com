process: Whether augmented bolt-on resources or individual projects, we utilize Kanban or Scrum for our agile workflows. We are not interested in waterfall or pure chaos. All engagements are tracked hourly, invoiced weekly, and require NET-7. A successful engagement with us occurs when product and engineering work together with a shared vision and goals to completion.

metrics: At a foundational level, we believe automated tests are critical to the success of writing software. We advocate for community-driven, coding style approaches utilizing code linters and we grade our code with testing coverage metrics and style evaluation tools. If you are wanting to cut this corner, donâ€™t worry, you can find many cheaper options out there.

values: First and foremost, we are craftsmen. We intrinsically value the work we accomplish, the meticulous attention to detail, and the quality of the work we pass on. We understand that we are not perfect; software processes are not perfect; bugs are inevitable. With over 15 years of experience in technology from startups to enterprises, we understand every business presents a unique set of challenges, and we tailor our approach accordingly.
